  <p>In Feb 2009, I and my friends participated in Re-Kriti. It is an event organized during Synapse 2009 and was supported by National Innovation Foundation. The aim of the event was to provide some innovative solution for a given problem. Our team was taken a task to design a Self Dispensing Jug. </p>
  
<p> The problem statement mentioned that the jug should be able to detect the presence of glass, so we had a LDR circuit to do this function. It also mentioned that the jug should stop dispensing automatically. Therefore we had a timer circuit. We also had a water level detector in tank which detects low water level. Apart from these, we also kept an electromagnetic valve for water ejection. </p>
  
<p> The whole system could be assembled in just Rs. 350. We won consolation prize for it. </p>
