Hi, I am Darsh. I am a second year masters student pursuing MS in Information Networking at Information Networking Institute, Carnegie Mellon University.
</br></br>
 I did my undergrad at DA-IICT in Information and Communication Technology and worked as an Associate Engineer at Qualcomm for an year before joining CMU.
</br></br>
 During Summer of 2014, I did internship in the EFI (Firmware) team at Apple Inc in Cupertino. I was responsible for making infrastructure libraries to support diagnostics on production line. 
</br></br>
My focus of study is system software and distributed systems. I also like algorithms. My courses include Cloud Computing where I worked with Hadoop and Hbase, Engineering Distributed Systems in which I got a chance to work with Coda File Systems and CMUâ€™s most famous course 15-213 in which I implemented my own malloc library. 
</br></br>
Currently, I am a Teaching Assistant of 14-740 Fundamentals of Telecommunications and Computer Networks course at CMU. I am looking for full time opportunities and will be graduating in May 2015.
